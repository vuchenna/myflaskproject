<h4>The Brief:</h4>
The overall objective of this project is “To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.
This includes the following:
<ul>
<li>A Trello Board with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks</li>
<li>A relational Database with at least 2 tables in it and a modelled relationship</li>
<li>Documentation describing the architecture that will be used and a detailed Risk Assessment</li>
<li>Functional CRUD application created in Python</li>
<li>A documented TDD approach, fully designed test suites and automated tests for validation of the application</li>
<li>A functioning front-end website and integrated API's using Flask</li>
<li>Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine</li>
</ul>
<h4>Deliverables</h4>
The web application being created based on the standard music streamig applications such as spotify or apple music however it allows the user to create playlists based on their mood or activity.To accomplish the project aims & objectives the web application being created will include the following functionalities as the Minimunm Viable product:
<ul>
  <li>Create user accounts that stores User First and Last Name, User Email and User Password</li>
  <li>Login/Logout</li>
  <li>View and Update account details</li>
  <li>Create a music playlist and assign it to a mood or activity</li>
  <li>Navigate through the music database using the search bar</li>
  <li>Delete songs from playlist or delete entire playlists.</li>
Additional functionalities to the minimum viable product will include:
  <li>Rate playlist based on playlist meaning specified labels e.g (rate playlist on best to worst playlist for running)</li>
<li>Make comments on playlist</li>
</ul>
<h4>Solution</h4>

My project is focused on the benefits of music therapy for mental health and well-being. The web app is created to allow users to upload and stream music depending on their mood or activity. The User has their own personal playlist of their uploads but they can also add songs from the music library into their personal playlist.

<h4>Mood:</h4>
Moods can include:
Stress relief, Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS), Anxiety Relief, Grief etc

Activity:
Activities can include:
Workout, Confidence boosting music (ideal for interviews and presenting), yoga

<h4>Trello Board for project planning</h4>
I used trello for project tracking and to monitor my progress for the app creation. Please click the link below to have a look:

<h4>Risk Assessment</h4>
The risk assessment for this project utilises the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis(FMEA) Methodology. Here I identified the risks and mitigations for my app

<h4> Automation & CI Pipeline </h4>
I used Jenkins for the build and automation of my app. I used a github webhook to automate a build whenever new code is added to my GCP virtual machine and commited to github.

<h4>Programming Languages used:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
